# Unhandled Promise Rejections in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: improper handling of asynchronous operations that can result in unhandled promise rejections.  The `bug.js` file showcases this issue, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Problem

The original code uses promises but lacks a proper `catch` block within the asynchronous operation handler to manage potential errors gracefully.  This means that if the asynchronous operation fails, the error isn't handled, leading to an unhandled promise rejection, which could cause unexpected behavior or crashes depending on the environment.

## Solution

The solution (`bugSolution.js`) provides comprehensive error handling. It includes a `catch` block that captures potential errors, logs them for debugging purposes, and sends an appropriate error response to the client, providing a better user experience and more robust application stability.
